# Execute expressions without an alternate evaluator

This ExecPlan is a living document. Maintain Progress, Surprises & Discoveries,
Decision Log, and Outcomes & Retrospective according to root PLANS.md.

## Purpose / Big Picture


The user now requires complete removal of expression execution fallback, not
another performance-only extension of the eager whitelist. An expression which
previously worked must retain its SQL result, demanded arguments, side effects,
and diagnostic contents while executing through one shared execution model.
Scalar and vector kernels inside that model are acceptable; calling the old
expression evaluator after preparation fails is not the final architecture.
Resource and SQL failures must remain failures, not retries through another
interpreter. Warning/error relative ordering remains explicitly relaxed by the
previous user contract; demand and side-effect ordering do not.

## Progress


- [x] (2026-10-17) Recover paired baseline: TiDB bf4723283aadba5fbde116a7572c2aac18a887ba,
  TiKV d32cebb3ebc353748cb225fe254d6893e62c8bdc; existing unrelated untracked
  tikv-client-rs BUILD.bazel must not be staged.
- [x] Read both AGENTS.md files, root PLANS.md, and existing implementation.
- [x] (2026-10-17) N1: Terminal preparation errors are cached and propagated; regression fails before fix, batch35 pass, full1387 pass/same4 known failures/95ignored, lint and scoped fmt pass.
- [ ] N2: Remove single-output/column-owner shape refusals through projection scheduling.
- [ ] N3: Admit shared STRCMP, CONCAT and JSON_TYPE with exact native SQL contracts.
- [ ] N4: Execute lazy control flow with demanded rows in the shared engine.
- [ ] N5: Cover remaining calls, source metadata, host context and non-projection callers.
- [ ] N6: Remove alternate-evaluator dispatch and migration state; validate full SQL,
  shared-library and release-server cohorts and report remaining performance costs.

## Surprises & Discoveries


The existing public run_with_tikv_window catches every preparation error,
including ResourceLimit and contract errors, stores only a bounded refusal code,
and then calls self.run. This loses the error and can bypass the intended
resource policy. Execution failures after successful preparation already
propagate without replay. suite_shape also rejects all multi-output suites,
column mappings and owner swaps, even if their functions are individually
supported. The static 68/131 signature count is not all SQL call coverage. N1 exposed a
previously hidden malformed specification: catalog IS NULL permits JSON-to-String
coercion, but this batch source did not insert a cast. Check the shared signature's
actual argument/result carriers before compilation so this known capability gap
is classified as admission, rather than swallowing arbitrary InvalidSpec errors.

## Decision Log


- Decision: Start by making resource/contract/evaluation preparation failures
  observable typed errors, cached before any value or context effects.
  Rationale: A no-fallback executor must not trade correctness/resource gates
  for coverage. Ordinary unsupported shapes remain explicitly unfinished until
  the subsequent capability milestones cover them.
  Date/Author: 2026-10-17 / TiDBEngineer.
- Decision: Reuse TiKV-owned algorithms and local execution; never add a second
  TiDB-specific function implementation to improve a route counter.
  Rationale: The goal is execution unification with compatibility, not renaming
  the current fallback or replacing valid SQL with unsupported errors.
  Date/Author: 2026-10-17 / TiDBEngineer.

## Outcomes & Retrospective


N1 regression reproduced the bug before implementation: the oversized metadata gate returned successful generic evaluation instead of a resource error. Cached typed errors now pass batch35 and full1387 with exactly the same4 inherited failures. The first candidate exposed the existing JSON-to-String catalog conversion gap; explicit carrier admission fixed its classification without swallowing InvalidSpec. TiKV is unchanged. Next is N2; ordinary unsupported-expression routing is still present and goal remains incomplete. None of the remaining fallback workloads has been
claimed fixed. Each self-contained code milestone must have targeted regression
coverage, required lint, and a Signed-off-by commit; temporary migration routing
must be reported explicitly until removed. Do not use the earlier performance
pass's cost boundary as authorization to stop this new goal.

## Context and Orientation


Worktrees are /home/agent/tidb/expression-unification/tidb and its sibling tikv.
TiDB rust/crates/tidb-expr/src/evaluator.rs owns projection scheduling and the
BatchLane state. evaluator/batch.rs authenticates program/schema/column bindings
and calls TiKV local execution. scalar_function.rs and pushdown_catalog.rs own
SQL argument demand and native-to-shared call selection. TiKV
components/tidb_query_expr/src/local/profile.rs contains the eager capability
contract; local program/frame execution and types/expr_eval.rs implement shared
execution. Existing generic evaluation also calls shared kernels but retains a
separate expression driver; merely relabeling it is not elimination.

## Plan of Work


N1 adds a cached terminal preparation-failure lane and preserves its typed
EvaluatorError across repeated calls, with a real oversized metadata regression
which fails before the change. N2 replaces whole-suite single-root assumptions
with per-output scheduling while delaying column-owner moves until all computed
outputs succeed. N3 connects existing shared call implementations, preserving
collation, packet limits, NULL and JSON representation/error behavior. N4 adds
row demand for IF/CASE/COALESCE/NULLIF/AND/OR without eager evaluation of skipped
branches. N5 inventories and closes every other entry and semantic domain,
including temporal/numeric policies, casts, host operations, filters and scalar
entrypoints. N6 deletes the now-unreachable legacy expression driver and records
source/route evidence plus SQL and performance verification.

## Concrete Steps


Run commands from the TiDB worktree unless noted. Use the established environment:

    export RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1 RUSTFLAGS='' CC=gcc-14 CXX=g++-14
    export CXXFLAGS='-include cstdint' CMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
    export CARGO_HOME=/home/agent/tidb/expression-unification/cargo-home
    export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=/home/agent/tidb/expression-unification/target-tidb
    cargo test --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml --release --locked --offline -j2 -p tidb-expr --lib evaluator::batch::tests
    make lint

Check the target's existing artifacts and toolchain before building. Save output
under /home/agent/.slock/agents/1555103c-9f3e-46ca-ac2e-b964c650c2f1/evidence/no-fallback/.
Inspect every changed file, run scoped rustfmt and git diff --check, then commit
only task-owned files with git commit -s. No broad git add and no destructive
cleanup of the unrelated BUILD file.

## Validation and Acceptance


N1 must return the same structured resource error on the first and second call,
with zero fallback, no eligibility/value reads and untouched input/output. Existing
supported workloads remain prepared and unsupported cases remain transparently
reported as migration gaps. Later milestones must compare against independent
results and frozen-native oracles, not only against the migrated implementation.
Include NULLs, reverse/duplicate/empty selections, over-1024 windows, all result
carriers, multi-output aliasing, short-circuit errors/effects and resource limits.
Final acceptance includes no production path replaying another expression
interpreter, supported SQL retaining compatibility, and published route evidence.
Full existing suites have four known TiDB and six known TiKV failures; compare
exact identities, never silently ignore new failures. Run release SQL/real-cluster
checks when changes reach their caller paths and stop owned test services afterward.

## Idempotence and Recovery


Tests and builds are repeatable. Each code checkpoint must be independently
runnable. Preserve rejected experiments as patches/evidence and reverse only
owned changes; never reset the workspace or rewrite the paired baseline. Update
this plan and workspace memory before each context transition.

## Artifacts and Notes


Baseline performance evidence is in docs/expression-unification/PERFORMANCE_EVOLUTION_REPORT.md.
The 64 workload benchmark includes six generic fallback examples; it does not
cover every SQL function or multi-output SELECT. New evidence must state exactly
what route and caller it measures and must preserve slow results.

## Interfaces and Dependencies


Keep EvaluatorSuite public caller signatures stable while migrating internals.
Retain typed EvaluatorError/ExpressionRuntimeFailure propagation. BatchLane may
cache an EvaluatorError (which is Clone) to avoid recomputing or losing a terminal
preparation failure. A future shared execution extension must continue owning
resource accounting and must not expose arbitrary Rust callbacks as an unchecked
escape into the old interpreter.
